# NLP_Classification_Chatbot
This project aims to explores the concept of building a basic chatbot model which can be integrated within any UI framework. This model is built on the concepts of NLTK text classification and forms the core engine of a conversational chatbot.

The model refers to an input file (leaves.txt) which contains a corpus of text which serves as a base in framing responses to typical leave application queries.
